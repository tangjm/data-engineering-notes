Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+

Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree.

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

    "Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
    "Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
    "Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

x is a Leaf iff x doesn't feature as the p_id of any record
x is a Root iff x has a NULL p_id
x is an Inner iff x is not a Leaf and x is not a Root

An integer in the `id` column for some record but not in the `p_id` column for any record is a Leaf.
We do this by comparing each `id` to each `p_id`.


Root Nodes 
```sql
SELECT *
FROM tree
WHERE p_id IS NULL
```
```json
{"headers": ["id", "p_id"], "values": [[1, null]]}
```

<!-- Root nodes
```sql
SELECT
  t1.p_id,
  t2.id
FROM tree t1
LEFT JOIN tree t2
  ON t2.id = t1.p_id
GROUP BY id
```

```json
{"headers": ["p_id", "id"], "values": [[null, null], [1, 1], [2, 2]]}
``` -->
This produces all Leaf nodes.
Leaf nodes are records where `t1.p_id` is null but `t2.id` is not null.
Inner nodes are records where `t2.id` = `t1.p_id` for all records.
Root nodes are `t2.id`'s for which some records are s.t. `t1.p_id` is null but `t2.id` is not null 
and other records are s.t. `t2.id` = `t1.p_id`.

```sql
SELECT
  t1.p_id,
  t2.id
FROM tree t1
RIGHT JOIN tree t2
  ON t2.id = t1.p_id
GROUP BY id
```

```json
{"headers": ["p_id", "id"], "values": [[1, 1], [2, 2], [null, 3], [null, 4], [null, 5]]}
```



```sql
WITH temp AS (
  SELECT
    p_id AS id,
    id AS p_id
  FROM tree
  WHERE p_id IS NULL

  UNION

  SELECT
    t1.p_id,
    t2.id
  FROM tree t1
  RIGHT JOIN tree t2
    ON t2.id = t1.p_id
  GROUP BY id
)

, classified AS (
SELECT
  *,
  CASE WHEN id = p_id THEN 'Inner'
       WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
       WHEN id IS NULL THEN 'Leaf'
  END AS type
FROM temp
)

SELECT 
  p_id AS id,
  CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 1 THEN 'Root'
       ELSE type
  END AS type
FROM classified
GROUP BY 1
```

`temp` table returns the following
```json
{"headers": ["id", "p_id"], "values": [[null, 1], [1, 1], [2, 2], [null, 3], [null, 4], [null, 5]]}
```

```sql
SELECT 
  CASE WHEN t2.p_id IS NULL THEN 
FROM tree t1
CROSS JOIN tree t2

```json
{"headers": ["id", "p_id", "id", "p_id"], 
"values": [[5, 2, 1, null], 
           [4, 2, 1, null], 
           [3, 1, 1, null], 
           [2, 1, 1, null], 
           [1, null, 1, null], 
           [5, 2, 2, 1], 
           [4, 2, 2, 1], 
           [3, 1, 2, 1], 
           [2, 1, 2, 1], 
           [1, null, 2, 1], 
           [5, 2, 3, 1], 
           [4, 2, 3, 1], 
           [3, 1, 3, 1], 
           [2, 1, 3, 1],
           [1, null, 3, 1],
           [5, 2, 4, 2], 
           [4, 2, 4, 2], 
           [3, 1, 4, 2], 
           [2, 1, 4, 2], 
           [1, null, 4, 2], 
           [5, 2, 5, 2], 
           [4, 2, 5, 2], 
           [3, 1, 5, 2], 
           [2, 1, 5, 2], 
           [1, null, 5, 2]
           ]}
```


### Second pass

Root nodes

```sql
SELECT
  *,
  'Root' AS type
FROM tree
WHERE p_id IS NULL
```

```json
{"headers": ["id", "p_id"], "values": [[1, null]]}
{"headers": ["id", "p_id"], "values": [[1, null]]}
```


Leaf nodes are those with a null `t2.p_id`

```sql
SELECT
  t1.id,
  t2.p_id,
  'Leaf' AS type
FROM tree t1
LEFT JOIN tree t2
  ON t2.p_id = t1.id
WHERE t2.p_id IS NULL
```

```json
{"headers": ["id", "p_id", "type"], "values": [[3, null, "Leaf"], [4, null, "Leaf"], [5, null, "Leaf"]]}
{"headers": ["id", "p_id", "type"], "values": [[1, null, "Leaf"]]}
```

Inner nodes

```sql
SELECT 
  t1.p_id,
  t2.id,
  'Inner' AS type
FROM tree t1
INNER JOIN tree t2
  ON t2.id = t1.p_id
    AND t2.p_id IS NOT NULL
```

```json
{"headers": ["p_id", "id"], "values": [[2, 2], [2, 2]]}
{"headers": ["p_id", "id"], "values": []}
```




```sql
WITH type_classification AS (
SELECT
  *,
  'Root' AS type
FROM tree
WHERE p_id IS NULL

UNION

SELECT
  t1.id,
  t2.p_id,
  'Leaf' AS type
FROM tree t1
LEFT JOIN tree t2
  ON t2.p_id = t1.id
WHERE t2.p_id IS NULL

UNION

SELECT 
  t1.p_id,
  t2.id,
  'Inner' AS type
FROM tree t1
INNER JOIN tree t2
  ON t2.id = t1.p_id
    AND t2.p_id IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT
  id,
  type
FROM type_classification
ORDER BY 1
```

```json
{"headers": ["id", "p_id", "type"], "values": [[1, null, "Root"], [3, null, "Leaf"], [4, null, "Leaf"], [5, null, "Leaf"], [2, 2, "Inner"]]}
{"headers": ["id", "p_id", "type"], "values": [[1, null, "Root"], [1, null, "Leaf"]]}
```
