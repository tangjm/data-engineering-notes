Write an SQL query to report the patient_id, patient_name all conditions of patients who have Type I Diabetes. Type I Diabetes always starts with DIAB1 prefix.

We can't use SPLIT_PART as it isn't supported by MySQL

```sql
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE conditions REGEXP '^DIAB1|\\sDIAB1' -- MySQL
-- WHERE conditions ~ '^DIAB1|\sDIAB1' -- Postgres
```

Either 'DIAB1' is at the start of the string or its preceded by a space.
'^DIAB1|\sDIAB1'

We need to use '\\s' instead of '\s' in MySQL. [Explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15558172/mysql-regexp-whitespace-s)
