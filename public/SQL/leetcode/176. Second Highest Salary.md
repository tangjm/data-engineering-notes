```sql
WITH max_salary AS (
  SELECT 
    MAX(salary) as max_salary
  FROM Employee
)

SELECT 
  (CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN MAX(salary) END) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
CROSS JOIN max_salary
WHERE salary != max_salary
```


```sql
SELECT
  IFNULL(
    (SELECT 
      DISTINCT(salary)
    FROM employee
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    LIMIT 1
    OFFSET 1), NULL
  ) AS "SecondHighestSalary"
```

The subquery returns an empty result set if there is only one record in Employee. Selecting from an empty result set then produces a NULL value. 
```sql
SELECT
  (SELECT 
    DISTINCT Salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY Salary DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
```

But this doesn't work if we make the subquery into a CTE. It would also produce an empty result set.

```sql
WITH temp AS (
  SELECT
    DISTINCT salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY Salary DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
)

SELECT 
  salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM temp
```
