Write an SQL query to report the IDs of all the employees with missing information. The information of an employee is missing if:

    The employee's name is missing, or
    The employee's salary is missing.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

Employees whose id occurs in only one of the two tables.

There's no FULL OUTER JOIN in MySQL.

```sql
SELECT 
  e.employee_id
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN salaries s 
  ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id 
WHERE salary IS NULL

UNION 

SELECT
  s.employee_id 
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN salaries s
  ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id
WHERE name IS NULL

ORDER BY 1
```

Alternative solution

```sql
SELECT 
  employee_id
FROM (
  SELECT e.employee_id FROM employees e
  UNION ALL
  SELECT s.employee_id FROM salaries s
) temp
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
ORDER BY 1
```
