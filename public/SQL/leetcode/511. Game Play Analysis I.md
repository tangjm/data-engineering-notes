Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.

 

Write an SQL query to report the first login date for each player.

### Solution 1

```sql
WITH activity_with_ordered_dates AS (
  SELECT 
    *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date)
  FROM activity
)

SELECT 
  player_id,
  event_date AS first_login
FROM activity_with_ordered_dates
WHERE row_number = 1
```

### Solution 2

We can also self-join the activity table to itself. 

For each player_id, we can define the record of their first login as the record with an event_date for which there is no record in the table that has the same player_id but lower event_date.

For each player_id, we want to find the record $x$ s.t.

$$\neg \exists y ( y.player\_id = x.player\_id \land y.event\_date < x.event\_date )$$

```sql
SELECT 
  a1.player_id,
  a1.event_date AS first_login
FROM activity a1
LEFT JOIN activity a2
  ON a2.player_id = a1.player_id
    AND a2.event_date < a1.event_date
WHERE a2.event_date IS NULL
```

### Solution 3

```sql
SELECT 
  player_id,
  MIN(event_date) AS first_login
FROM activity
GROUP BY 1
```
