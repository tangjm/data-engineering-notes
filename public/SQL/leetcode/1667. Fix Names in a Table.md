Write an SQL query to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTRING(name, 1, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(name, 2))) AS name
FROM users
ORDER BY 1
```

```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  initcap(name)
FROM users
ORDER BY 1
```
