CH241 

Make a chart that would show monthly number of signups for the past 6 month.

TO_CHAR and DATE_TRUNC gives us the same results.

Using TO_CHAR

```sql
SELECT 
  TO_CHAR(created_at, 'yyyy-mm') AS m,
  COUNT(*) AS signups
FROM users
WHERE created_at > now() - '6 month'::interval
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```
Using DATE_TRUNC

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) AS m,
  COUNT(*) AS signups
FROM users
WHERE
  created_at > now() - '6 months'::interval
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

Why not use DATE_PART?

It seems that DATE_PART will also always return at most 12 records. But if we wanted, say, the records for the last 2 years, it would aggregate the signups for the same months, because '2' would denote the number of signups in February regardless of the year or date, precisely because we only extracted 'month' part. In this case, it would include the number of signups in February last year and in Februrary two years ago. 

This means that we should avoid using DATE_PART if we are creating a timeline that goes back more than a year in time. But anything under a year should be fine. That being said, because DATE_PART returns integers, it makes it hard to chronologically order the rows, because 12 or the last month December isn't always the latest month. Suppose the current month is September and we're measuring signups for the last two years. In this case, August would be the lastest month.

In short, use T0_CHAR or DATE_TRUNC to avoid the problems that face DATE_PART.
