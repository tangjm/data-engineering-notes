Calculate ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of the control variation of the longer_onboarding_201803 AB-test.

In short, what is the sum-total purchase amounts for each member of the control cohort divided by the control cohort size

```sql
WITH ab_test_categorization AS (
	SELECT
		custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_variation' AS variation,
		COUNT(DISTINCT(e.user_id)) AS cohort_size,
		COUNT(DISTINCT(p.user_id)) AS customers,
		SUM(p.amount) AS total_revenue
	FROM mobile_analytics.events e
	LEFT JOIN purchases p
		ON e.user_id = p.user_id
			AND p.refunded = 'f'
	WHERE custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_name' = 'longer_onboarding_201803'
		AND action = 'signup'
	GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT
  *,
  total_revenue / cohort_size AS ARPU
FROM ab_test_categorization

```
