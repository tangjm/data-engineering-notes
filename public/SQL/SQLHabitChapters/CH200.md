Calculate the control cohort size of the longer_onboarding_201803 AB-test.

```json
{
"ab_test_name": "<string>",
"ab_test_variation": "<string>"
}
```

```sql
SELECT
	custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_variation' AS variation,
	COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) AS cohort_size
FROM
	mobile_analytics.events
WHERE 
	custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_name' = 'longer_onboarding_201803'
GROUP BY 1
```


Model answer
```sql
WITH ab_test_categorization AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_name' AS ab_test_name,
    custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_variation' AS ab_test_variation,
    created_at AS categorized_at
  FROM mobile_analytics.events
  WHERE
    custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_name' IS NOT NULL
    AND action = 'signup'
)    

SELECT
  ab_test_variation,
  COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id))
FROM ab_test_categorization
WHERE
  ab_test_name = 'longer_onboarding_201803'
GROUP BY 1
```

Why filter for `action = 'signup'`?
- Because we want to only consider users categorised at signup and not through other ways if they happen to exist.
  
Why don't we also need to filter for `'ab_test_variation' IS NOT NULL` in addition to `'ab_test_name" IS NOT NULL`
- Our application is designed so that it's impossible for there to be a row with a null ab_test_name but a non-null ab_test_variation. Such a value for the custom_parameters field would signify an error.
