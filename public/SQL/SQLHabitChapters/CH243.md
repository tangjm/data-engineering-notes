First pass at creating a table with the number of signups for both the current and previous day.

```sql {.line-numbers highlight=[5, 18]}
WITH daily_signups AS (
SELECT
  created_at::date AS d,
  COUNT(*) AS signups,
  ROW_NUMBER() over (ORDER BY created_at::date) AS day_num
FROM users
WHERE created_at > now() - '30 days'::interval
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
)

SELECT 
  c.d,
  c.signups,
  p.signups AS prev_signups,
  ROUND(100.0 * (c.signups - p.signups) / p.signups, 2) AS trend
FROM daily_signups c
LEFT JOIN daily_signups p  
  ON c.day_num = p.day_num + 1
```

We don't need to the ROW_NUMBER window function

```sql {.line-numbers highlight=[17, 18]}
WITH daily_signups AS (
SELECT
  created_at::date AS d,
  COUNT(*) AS signups
FROM users
WHERE created_at > now() - '30 days'::interval
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
)

SELECT 
  c.d,
  c.signups,
  p.signups AS prev_signups,
  ROUND(100.0 * (c.signups - p.signups) / p.signups, 2) AS trend
FROM daily_signups c
INNER JOIN daily_signups p  
  ON c.d = p.d + '1 day'::interval
```

Why do we use INNER JOIN instead of LEFT JOIN on line 17?

To ignore the 30th day since the current time because calculating the trend for that day would require signup data for the 31st day which is outside of the last 30 days time period.


calculate trends and make a chart for refunded purchases from the previous exercise:

```sql {.line-numbers highlight=[8, 9]}
SELECT
  CASE WHEN refunded_at IS NULL THEN 'success' ELSE 'refund' END AS purchase_state,
  created_at::date AS d,
  COUNT(*)
FROM purchases
WHERE
  created_at > now() - '30 days'::interval
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```

The GROUP BY on line 8 groups records by unique combinations of created_at date and purchase_state.

The ORDER BY on line 9 orders records by their purchase_state in descending lexicographical order for records with different purchase_state. For records with the same purchase_state, we order them in ascending order of created_at date (ascending order is the default).
