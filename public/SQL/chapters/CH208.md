Calculate an uplift in soft activation rate for longer_onboarding_201803 AB-test.

Uplift is the difference between the non-control variation and the control variation metric divided by the control variation metric

\[ \frac{\text{non-control variation metric} - \text{control variation metric}}{\text{control variation metric}} \]

In this case, the metric is the soft activation rate

The trick to ensure that the control variation cohort always remains at the top of the is to use this:

```sql 
ORDER BY CASE WHEN variation = 'control' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END 
```

### First pass

```sql
WITH ab_test_categorisation AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_name' AS ab_test_name,
    custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_variation' AS ab_test_variation,
    created_at AS categorisation_date
  FROM mobile_analytics.events
  WHERE custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_name' IS NOT NULL
    AND action = 'signup'
),
ab_funnel AS (
	SELECT 
		ab_test_variation AS variation,
		COUNT(DISTINCT(a.user_id)) AS cohort_size,
		COUNT(DISTINCT(b.user_id)) AS users_with_books,
		100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT(b.user_id)) / COUNT(DISTINCT(a.user_id)) AS soft_activation_rate
	FROM ab_test_categorisation a
	LEFT JOIN books_users b
		ON a.user_id = b.user_id
	WHERE ab_test_name = 'longer_onboarding_201803'
	GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT 
	variation,
	cohort_size,
	ROUND(soft_activation_rate, 2) AS soft_activation_rate,
	ROUND(100.0 * (soft_activation_rate - FIRST_VALUE(soft_activation_rate) over ()) / FIRST_VALUE(soft_activation_rate) over (), 2) AS soft_activation_rate_uplift
FROM ab_funnel

```

### Model answer

```sql
WITH ab_test_categorisation AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_name' AS ab_test_name,
    custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_variation' AS ab_test_variation,
    created_at AS categorisation_date
  FROM mobile_analytics.events
  WHERE custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_name' IS NOT NULL
    AND action = 'signup'
),
ab_funnel AS (
	SELECT 
		ab_test_variation AS variation,
		COUNT(DISTINCT(a.user_id)) AS cohort_size,
		COUNT(DISTINCT(b.user_id)) AS users_with_books,
		100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT(b.user_id)) / COUNT(DISTINCT(a.user_id)) AS soft_activation_rate
	FROM ab_test_categorisation a
	LEFT JOIN books_users b
		ON a.user_id = b.user_id
	WHERE ab_test_name = 'longer_onboarding_201803'
	GROUP BY 1
),
ab_activation_metrics AS (
	SELECT
		variation,
		cohort_size,
		100.0 * users_with_books / cohort_size AS soft_activation_rate,
		FIRST_VALUE(100.0 * users_with_books / cohort_size) over () AS control_cohort_soft_activation_rate
	FROM ab_funnel
	ORDER BY 
		CASE WHEN variation = 'control' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END
)

SELECT 
	variation,
	cohort_size,
	ROUND(soft_activation_rate, 2),
	ROUND(100.0 * (soft_activation_rate - control_cohort_soft_activation_rate) / control_cohort_soft_activation_rate, 2) AS soft_activation_rate_uplift
FROM ab_activation_metrics
