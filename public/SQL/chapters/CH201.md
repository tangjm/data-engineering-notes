Calculate soft activation rate for variations of longer_onboarding_201803 AB-test. Submit activation rate of the control variation as the answer.

In other words, for each AB test variation cohort, what percentage of them added a book to their library?

Make use of the `action = 'add-library-entry'` mobile_analytics.event
Alternatively, look for users who appear in the books_users join table.

```sql

WITH ab_test_categorisation AS (
	SELECT 
		e.user_id AS categorised_users,
		e.custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_name' AS ab_test_name,
		e.custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_variation' AS ab_test_variation,
		e.created_at AS categorisation_date,
		b.user_id AS soft_users
	FROM mobile_analytics.events e
	LEFT JOIN mobile_analytics.events b
		ON e.user_id = b.user_id
			AND b.action = 'add-library-entry'
	WHERE e.custom_parameters ->> 'ab_test_name' IS NOT NULL 
		AND e.action = 'signup'
)

SELECT
	ab_test_variation,
	COUNT(DISTINCT(categorised_users)) AS cohort_size,
	COUNT(DISTINCT(soft_users)) AS soft_users,
	100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT(soft_users)) / COUNT(DISTINCT(categorised_users)) AS soft_activation_rate
FROM ab_test_categorisation
WHERE ab_test_name = 'longer_onboarding_201803'
GROUP BY 1
