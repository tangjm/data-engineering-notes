How many unique visitors who clicked the adjust link installed the app?
number of install events / number of Adjust link click events

```sql
SELECT
	COUNT(
		DISTINCT(
			CASE
				WHEN activity_kind = 'click' THEN label
			END
		)
	) AS signup_link_clicks,
	COUNT(
		DISTINCT(
			CASE
				WHEN activity_kind = 'install' THEN label
			END
		)
	) AS unique_installs,
	100 * COUNT(
		DISTINCT(
			CASE
				WHEN activity_kind = 'install' THEN label
			END
		)
	) / COUNT(
		DISTINCT(
			CASE
				WHEN activity_kind = 'click' THEN label
			END
		)
	) :: float AS conversion_rate
FROM
	adjust.callbacks 
WHERE 
	adgroup_name = 'website'
	AND tracker = 'gxel3d1' -- we only consider website Adjust activity (this actually makes no difference for the given bindle data set)
```

The same result is obtained if we aggregated the 'id' instead of 'label' column and removed the DISTINCT since 'id's are unique.
