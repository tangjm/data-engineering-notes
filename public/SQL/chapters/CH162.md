Out of the number of distinct users, how many have used the app on an iphone

```sql
WITH signups_and_devices AS (
	SELECT
		COUNT(DISTINCT(u.id)) AS unique_users,
		COUNT(DISTINCT(d.user_id)) AS users_with_mobile_app
	FROM
		users u
		LEFT JOIN devices d ON u.id = d.user_id
		AND d.device_type = 'iphone'
	WHERE
		u.created_at >= '2018-02-01'
)
SELECT
	100 * users_with_mobile_app / unique_users :: float AS percentage_with_mobile_app
FROM
	signups_and_devices 
```

Alternative query using connected_at date which will always be >= signup date

```sql
SELECT
	100.0 * COUNT(
		DISTINCT(
			CASE
				WHEN device_type = 'iphone' THEN user_id
			END
		)
	) / COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id))
FROM
	devices
WHERE
	connected_at :: date >= '2018-02-01'
```
