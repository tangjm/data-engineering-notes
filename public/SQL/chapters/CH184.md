Calculate the soft activation rate for all mobile signups.

2.num of unique signups 
3.num of unique 'add-library-entry' events 
For each signed up user, we want to know if they have performed an 'add-library-entry' event
adjust.callbacks LEFT JOIN mobile_analytics.events ON user_id 

```sql
WITH signups_and_book_interactions AS (
	SELECT
		COUNT(DISTINCT(a.user_id)) AS signups,
		COUNT(DISTINCT(e.user_id)) AS users_added_book_to_library
	FROM
		adjust.callbacks a
		LEFT JOIN mobile_analytics.events e ON a.user_id = e.user_id
		AND e.action = 'add-library-entry'
	WHERE
		a.activity_kind = 'event'
		AND a.event_name = 'signup'
)
SELECT
	100.0 * users_added_book_to_library / signups AS soft_activation_rate
FROM
	signups_and_book_interactions
```
