D14 Retention Rate
out of the users who signed up on Feb 1, 2018, how many performed some action on Feb 15, 2018?

```sql
WITH user_activity AS (
	SELECT
		s.user_id,
		s.created_at :: date AS signup_date,
		e.created_at :: date AS event_date
	FROM mobile_analytics.events s
	LEFT JOIN mobile_analytics.events e 
		ON s.user_id = e.user_id
	WHERE s.action = 'signup'
	GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
	ORDER BY signup_date, user_id
),

retention_curve AS (
	SELECT
		event_date,
		COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) AS active_users
	FROM user_activity
	WHERE signup_date = '2018-02-01'
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 1
)

SELECT
	100.0 * d14.active_users / d1.active_users AS d14_retention_rate
FROM retention_curve d1, retention_curve d14
WHERE 
	d1.event_date = '2018-02-01'
	AND d14.event_date = '2018-02-15'
```

alternative solution

```sql
WITH user_activity AS (
	SELECT
		s.user_id,
		s.created_at :: date AS signup_date,
		e.created_at :: date AS event_date
	FROM mobile_analytics.events s
	LEFT JOIN mobile_analytics.events e 
		ON s.user_id = e.user_id
	WHERE s.action = 'signup'
	GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
	ORDER BY signup_date, user_id
),

retention_curve AS (
	SELECT
		event_date,
		COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) AS active_users,
		ROW_NUMBER() over () - 1 AS day,
		FIRST_VALUE(COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id))) over () AS d1_activity
	FROM user_activity
	WHERE signup_date = '2018-02-01'
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 1
)

SELECT 
  *,
  100.0 * active_users / d1_activity AS retention_rate
FROM retention_curve
WHERE day = 14
```
