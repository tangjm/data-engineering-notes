# The Northern Ireland Protocol

The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed between the UK and the EU in 2019 and is now part of international law. It's a special trading arrangement for Northern Ireland after UK voted for Brexit. 

It is needed as Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shared a border with an EU country, namely, Ireland.

A new customs controls system is needed now that Northern Ireland is no longer a member of the EU as the EU has strict food rules and requires border checks for non-eu goods like milk and eggs.

### The trading arrangment

Customs controls will be put into place between the UK and NI rather than between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Inspections and document checks for imports from the UK will take place at Northern Ireland's ports.

Northern Ireland would also continue to follow EU rules on product standards.

### DUP opposition to the protocol

The DUP is unhappy with the protocol as it effectively puts in place a sea border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

It's threatening to not take part in  Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, the Northern Ireland Assembly unless its concerns are resolved.

### The UK government's proposal

The UK government is making three proposals:

1. To allay the DUP's concerns, the UK government is proposing a separate system for goods whose final destination is Northern Ireland. These goods will be exempt from border checks.

2. The tax rules would also be changed. Northern irish businesses are currently governed by EU rules on state aid and VAT rules. This means EU limits apply to subsidies paid out in Northern Ireland and to tax breaks. The new proposal would remove these restraints.

3. The UK government also wants an independent body to settle disputes over the Nothern Ireland Protocol, rather than the European Court of Justice.

### UK government's justification of its move

The UK government argues that they're performing the lesser of two evils. They say disputes about the protocol threatens to undermine the Good Friday Agreement and peace in Northern Ireland.

### EU response to UK government's proposal

It is unwilling to renegotiate the protocol but has offered suggestions for improving how the protocol is implemented, including:
  
- reducing customs and sanitary checks on goods going from GB to NI
- reducing paperwork for agri-food shipments to a three-page document per lorry
- relaxing rules so chilled meats like sausages could still be sent across the Irish Sea to NI.

The UK has 2 months to respond before the EU considers taking UK to the European Court of Justice.

There is also the possibility of a trade war between the UK and the EU.
