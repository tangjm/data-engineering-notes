# The Climate of Brexit in 2022

It has been a year since the UK and the EU signed their Brexit deal and both remainers and brexiteers are unhappy with how Brexit has turned out. Only 4% of remainers and 34% of brexiteers are pleased with how things are going. 

There has been a rising cost of living affecting food prices, taxes and energy bills, which is contrary to what was promised by Brexit.

### Is Brexit to blame?

A purported benefit of bexit was lowering living costs. But the opposite has happend with rising taxes and food and energy prices.

Food prices are up 1% from the last 12 months according to ONS data.
Reasons:
- Global rise in energy prices has increased transport costs.
- Natural gas shortage has increased fertiliser costs as fetiliser plants require natural gas to produce ammonia 
- Brexit has made trading between the EU more expensive
- Immigration restrictions has impacted available HGV drivers

### Food prices

- Trade deals that lower food prices have not been realised. They face a difficult dilemma that either involves lowering food standards to an unacceptable level or involving terms that would be politically difficult or impossible to justify.

Examples
- A trade deal with the USA on chlorinated chicken would significantly lower chicken prices, but that would be unaacceptable to the british public
- Deals on lamb and beef with New Zealand and Australia could only lower costs if it has terms that would undercut local farmers, which would be politically hard to justify.

### Energy prices

- The rise in energy prices is largely due to a global rise in energy costs. The government could cut VAT for energy bills, but it won't because the government will make good money from the VAT on rising domestic energy bills and it needs to hedge against its spending pledges.

#### Context

Brexiteers argue that the UK can cut domestic energy prices by reducing energy bill VATs to 0% by leaving the EU.

Since 1994, EU member states must apply a VAT of at least 15% to all goods with an exception of at least 5% for certain goods like domestic energy. 

However, prior to 1994, VAT on energy bills was 0%.

A caveat is that the minimum VAT rate of 5% only applies if you charge decide to charge VAT on goods. So if the UK decides to not charge VAT on energy bills, then the VAT rate would be 0%.

But since the UK did decide to charge a VAT of 8% on energy bills in 1994 and increased it to 17.5% in 1995 before reducing it to 5% in 1997 for which it has stayed until now, leaving the EU would indeed permit the UK to reduce its VAT on domestic energy bills.

While VAT on energy bills has been at 5% for domestic energy costs, it has been at 20% for business energy costs.

The government has refused to cut the 5% VAT on domestic energy costs even after leaving Brexit. This is because certain members of the cabinet, like Rishi Sunak, want to balance the budget to keep up with Borris Johnson's spending pledges.

VAT on energy costs has also generated a huge tax revenue for the government. Labour estimates this to be a 3.1 billion pound windfall.

### Taxes

- There have been fewer than expected tax cuts mainly because the government needs to budget for the prime minister's spending projects.

#### Details

Brexit would lead to a low tax, entrepreneurial economy like Singapore.

There has mostly been no tax cuts with a few exceptions like VAT cuts on sanitary products which now have 0% VAT.

UK tax burden has been the highest it has been in 50 years, further worsened by a recent national insurance increase. 

The reason is because of Borris Johnson's spending projects which need to be backed up by increased taxation.

The trend has been high levels of public spending and high levels of taxation, which is similar to EU members which tend to have high tax burdens by international standards and extensive public services.

For now, we have to account for increasing global energy prices. The promised benefits of Brexit is yet to materialise.
