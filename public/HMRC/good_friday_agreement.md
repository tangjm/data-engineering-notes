# The Good Friday Agreement

- Helped to bring an end to the 30 years of the Troubles.
- Focused on culture, civil rights, justice and policing.

The Good Friday Agreement was signed on 10 April 1998.

The UK, Ireland and Northern Ireland political parties were involved.

It set up a power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly.

At the time the DUP, the present day largest party, was against the agreement.

Three main areas were agreed:

1. Set up a parliament to deal with local issues, namely, the Northern Ireland Assembly
2. Set up a countil to help both Northern Ireland and Ireland on farming and healthcare.
3. Set up a British-Irish council to promote the relationship between Britain and Ireland. 
   - Dual British-Irish citizenship
   - Return to peace time security arrangements
   - Removal of security installations
   - Illegal paramilitary groups to destroy weapons
  
Agreement accepted by both Northern Ireland and Ireland after a referendum was held.
