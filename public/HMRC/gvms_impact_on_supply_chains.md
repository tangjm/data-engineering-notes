### Problems with GVMS

- Shipments not loading on the GVMS system
- Reference codes not being accepted due to IT errors

### Impact

Delays have doubled in duration due to GVMS. Hauliers spend an average of 7 days  at British ports compared to 3.6 days April 2021. By contrast, average dwell times at EU ports are 5 days.

### Causes of delays

Government argues ferry maintance (ship refitting) to be the cause of delays in addition to higher than expected frieght volumes.

Unite, a union representing drivers, believes the custom controls are to blame. Drivers are taking 10 to 20 minutes to clear the necessary checks and the number customs agents dealing with paperwork isn't keeping up.
