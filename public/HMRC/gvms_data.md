### 1. What is GVMS?

31st December 2020, the UK Government introduced a new IT platform called GVMS to support the Pre-Lodgement model for both imports and exports and to facilitate Transit movements.

Pre-lodgement model will be especially helpful to RoRo (Roll on Roll off) locations.

- bundles declaration references for goods together so the person moving them only has to present a single reference at the frontier
- links the movement of goods to declarations
- Automates the Office of Transit function
- Notifies person in control of the goods of the risking outcome of declarations (whether they're held or cleared) in HMRC systems before they physically arrive in GB.


Haulier - an entity that moves goods (independent driver/sole trader; company that picks up goods on behalf of another business; logistics business; large retail business that transports and imports its own goods)

### 2. Registering for GVMS

Prerequisites:
- Government Gateway ID

A GMR can be created up to 28 days in advance of a crossing.

2. Select crossing destination and departure locations:
   1. Norway or EU port -> GB (England, Scotland, Wales)
   2. GB -> NI
   3. NI -> GB
3. Check the direction of the crossing
4. Draft GMR has been created confirmation page (includes the gmrId - unique identifier)
5. Fill in data (on this step you can delete the current GMR)
   1. Crossing data
      - Choose departure and arrival ports
      - Choose carrier (DFDS Seaways, P&O ferries; Irish Ferries; Unknown)
   2. Vehicle data
      - Select either accompanied (driver crosses alongside goods) or unaccompanied (only goods cross)
      - Vehicle number plate (not the container number plate)
   3. Declarations
      - Select whether your vehicle contains goods.
      - Add declarations one by one
        - Customs declaration

4. Inspection needed
   1. Report to the nearest Customs Inspection Site or Inland Border Facilities (IBF)
   2. Information on what to do if you're ending a transit movement

### 5. How to avoid and correct common errors

On the GVMS dashboard page, clicking a GMR id will take you to a page where you can correct errors.

All errors on the GVMS dashboard page must be resolved to avoid problems when the driver arrives to check-in with their GMR.

#### Common errors

Incorrect TAD MRN entered for Transit movements
Incorrect ERN or MRN from CHIEF or CDS
EIDR  
- You must enter the EORI of a trader who is authorised to use 'Simplified Customs Declaration Procedures'.
