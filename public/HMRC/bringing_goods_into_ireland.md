# Bringing goods into Ireland

### Paperwork

Submit an Entry Summary Declaration (ENS). This is the equivalent of a pre-lodged declaration specific to Ireland.

Create a Goods Movement Reference (GMR) for each movement.

Use either a Northern Irish (XI) number or an EORI to access HMRC's Import Control System (ICS) to lodge the ENS.

An EORI number is needed to access GVMS.

### Customs formalities

Great Britain -> Northern Ireland -> Ireland

Two options:
1. Complete import formalities in Northern Ireland (NI)
2. Use the transit procedure - raise a transit declaration in GB and complete import formalities in Ireland.

### Abbreviations

ENS - Entry Summary Declaration
ICS - Import Control System
EORI - Economic Operators Registration Identification
