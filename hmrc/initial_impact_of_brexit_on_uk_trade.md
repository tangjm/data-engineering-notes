### The initial impact of Brexit on UK trade with the EU

> The article discusses how well the recent data on UK trade volumes squares with their November 2016 assumption that Brexit will reduce UK imports and exports by 15%.

In actuality, relative to pre-pandemic and pre-Brexit trading volumes in 2019, UK exports to the EU and imports from the EU dropped by 45% and 30% respectively in January 2021.

By August 2021, trading volumes with non-eu countries recovered to 7% below average 2019 levels; trading volumes with the EU remained 15% below average 2019 levels.

To single out Brexit's impact on trade volumes, the Centre for European Reform conducted counterfactual analysis of the impact of Brexit on UK trade volumes.

Their report concluded that had there not been the pandemic, Brexit would have induced a 15.8% reduction in trade volumes as of August 2021. 

Because UK's export market share and import penetration largely track their November 2016 forecast, it suggests that trade volumes was already lowered even before Brexit.

> They believe that the explanation for this is due to people cutting back on trade volumes in anticipation that Brexit will bring about reduced UK-EU trade and in response to the uncertainty regarding trade with the EU created by the EU referendum.
