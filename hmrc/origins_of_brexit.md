# The origins of Brexit

In 1961, UK applied to be a member of the European Economic Community (also known as the Common Market - which existed to bring about economic inclusion)

France's prime minister, Charles de Gaulle, rejected the UK's application twice because of
1. the UK's close relation with the US 
2. and concerns that UK's economy was incompatible with the 6 existing members

In a referendum held 6 years after UK's joining, 67% favoured continued membership.

### The rebate

- Introduced by Margaret Thatcher.
- Reduced the UK's economic contribution to the EU.
- Still in place today

### The Opt-Out
The Uk doesn't have to participate in certain European policies.
E.g. 
1985 - UK didn't join Schengen area, maintaining a border with passport controls.
1992 - UK opts out of monetary union, retaining its pound sterling instead of switching to the euro.

### Maastricht Treaty - 7 Februrary 1992 
- Signed by the UK along with 11 other member states.
- Expanded the activites of the EU from purely economic affairs to foreign affairs, legal systems and policing.
- Sets up the framework for the modern EU

Eurosceptics in the UK believed that signing Maastricht Treaty transferred a lot of power from the UK government to the EU. 

For nearly 20 years, no referendum was held because of the economic benefits gained from being part of the EU. 

In 2004, 10 more members joined the EU, increasing concerns of the UK's level of immigration.

From 2004 to 2014, the number of EU migrants residing in the UK almost doubled.
During the same time from 2008, there was a fall in average UK household disposable income growth.

These two trends are regarded by some to have contributed to the feeling of resentment towards EU migrants.

Major political parties were slow to respond to this.

UKIP lead by Nigel Farage started to grow rapidly with support peaking at 16% of the electorate.

Because conservative MPs were concerned with their voters switching to UKIP, they pleaded with David Cameron to hold an EU referendum as part of his campaign manifesto to avoid the risk of voters defecting to UKIP.

Cameron promised a referendum by the end of 2017. 

In the meantime, he tried to renegotiate some of the terms of UK's EU membership. Eurosceptics were unconvinced that the EU was willing to compensate. 

Cameron set a date for an EU referendum in order to deliver on his manifesto promise.

The EU referendum was held on June 23rd 2016.
