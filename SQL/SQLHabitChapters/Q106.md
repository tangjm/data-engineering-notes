/*
Find a campaign with the highest ARPU.

For each campaign, calculate total_revenue / total_attributable_users

Group revenue and users by marketing campaign
*/

```sql
SELECT 
  utm_campaign,
  SUM(amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT(u.id)) AS ARPU
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN purchases p  
  ON p.user_id = u.id  
	AND refunded = 'f'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
/*
Instead of left joining the purchases tables to the users table, why couldn't we do the left join from the other direction?
*/
