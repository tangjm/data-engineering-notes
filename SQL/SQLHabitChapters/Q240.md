Write a query that returns both “Revenue last 30 days” and its trend (the percentage difference between the previous 30 days). Submit the trend value as the answer.


Compare the revenue for the last 30 days to the revenue for the previous last 30 days

```sql
WITH revenue AS (
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN created_at > now() - '30 days'::interval THEN amount END) AS last_30_days,
  SUM(CASE WHEN created_at BETWEEN now() - '60 days'::interval AND now() - '30 days'::interval THEN amount END) AS last_30_days_from_30_days_ago
FROM purchases
WHERE refunded_at IS NULL
)

SELECT 
  *,
  ROUND((last_30_days - last_30_days_from_30_days_ago) / last_30_days_from_30_days_ago) AS trend_rounded,
  (last_30_days - last_30_days_from_30_days_ago) / last_30_days_from_30_days_ago AS trend
FROM revenue

```
