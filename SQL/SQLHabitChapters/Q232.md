which marketing campaign had the most pageviews?

https\:\/\/www\.bindle\.com\/\?

```sql
SELECT 
  (REGEXP_MATCHES(url, 'utm_campaign=([\w-]+)&'))[1] AS campaign_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT(pageview_id)) AS pageviews
FROM web_analytics.pageviews
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

```sql
SELECT 
  SUBSTRING(url, 'utm_campaign=([\w-]+)&') AS campaign_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT(pageview_id)) AS pageviews
FROM web_analytics.pageviews
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

Model answer:
`&?utm_campaign=([\w-]+)&?`

why do we need `&?` as a prefix and suffix?

To ensure that we match utm_campaign parameters that are not mistyped, namely, aasdfssutm_campaign, and utm_campaign parameters that occur as the very first query string or appear at the very end of an url.

E.g.

`https://www.bindle.com/?utm_campaign=value&another_parameter`

`https://www.bindle.com/?utm_source=asdfasdf&sepcasutm_campaign=value`

`https://www.bindle.com/?utm_source=asdfasdf&utm_campaign=value`
