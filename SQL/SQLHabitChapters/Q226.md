Calculate the percentage of US users with a valid postal code. Round the final percentage to an integer number, for example, 18. 

```sql {.line-numbers highlight=[2, 5, 7]}
WITH us_postcodes AS (
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT(u.id)) AS us_users,
  COUNT(DISTINCT(p.user_id)) AS users_with_valid_postcode
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN profiles p  
  ON u.id = p.user_id
    AND p.postal_code ~ '^\d{5}(?:-\d{4})?$'
WHERE country ~ 'us'
)

SELECT 
  ROUND(100.0 * users_with_valid_postcode / us_users) AS percentage
FROM us_postcodes
```
