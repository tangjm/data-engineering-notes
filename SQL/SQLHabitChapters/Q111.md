Q111 Which campaign has the lowest CPA?

1. calculate the amount we spent on each campaign 
2. calculate the number of users attributable to each campaign 
3. divide 1 by 2 

```sql 
WITH spends AS (
	SELECT
		utm_campaign,
		SUM(amount) AS total_spends
	FROM marketing_spends
	GROUP BY 1
),
user_count AS (
	SELECT
		utm_campaign,
		COUNT(id) AS attributable_users
	FROM users
	GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT
	s.utm_campaign,
	total_spends / attributable_users AS CPA
FROM spends s
INNER JOIN user_count u 
	ON s.utm_campaign = u.utm_campaign
ORDER BY 2
```
