### 107. ARPPU 

```sql
SELECT
  SUM(amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT(u.id)) AS ARPPU
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN purchases p
  ON u.id = p.user_id
    AND refunded = FALSE
WHERE
  status = 'customer'
```
<!-- slide -->
Why couldn't we calculate it as follows?

```sql
SELECT
 SUM(amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) AS ARPPU
FROM purchases 
WHERE refunded = false
```


We need the users table after all because we have no guarantee that all users who have purchased a subscription will continue to renew their subscription.


This second query may count more customers than there actually are at the time of running the query since previous customers who have not renewed their subscription will still appear in the purchases table in virtue of having their purchase recorded, but will not appear to have 'customer' status in the users table. 


In short, the difference is that the second query calculates the average revenue for all users who have ever had customer status, whereas the first query calculates average revenue for only existing customers.
