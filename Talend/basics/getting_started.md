### Key terms
Component - a predefined unit of Java code that performs specific operations on data (implementation is hidden by default)
Job - comprises one or more SubJobs
SubJob - comprises one or more connected components performing a specific task
Row - carries data to the next component
Trigger - transfers proccessing control to the next component or SubJob

```

### Creating a Job

Job Designs -> right click -> create job

Adding a component

1. click in the designer and type in the name of a component
2. drag a component from the palette and place in designer

Linking components

1. rClick first component
2. Select row
3. Select main
4. Select second component to link to 



Renaming components

1. Select component
2. View tab
3. Label format

Help page
1. Click component
2. F1

### Talend components 

- [ ] tLogRow
- [ ] tPostjob
- [ ] tDBClose
- [ ] tDBInput
- [ ] tDBConnection
- [ ] tFileInputDelimited
- [ ] tFileInputJSON
- [ ] tFileInputXML


Main row

Main rows pass the data flow from one component to another, iterating on each row and reading input data according to the componentâ€™s properties setting.

Schemas
Schemas logically assemble and group data that will be read and processed by a component.

### Repository Metadata

Metadata is stored in the Repository and can be reused across jobs and components.

Built-in data - properties specific to a component
Repository properties - properties stored in the repository that can be reused

Generic schemas - can be used by any component; often  used to configure components of different types with the same schema

Changes to the repository metadata can be selectively propogated to all jobs and components making use of that metadata.

Changing the Property Type of a component to built-in severs the link between that component and the repository metadata.

Use impact analysis before updating metadata to see which jobs and components will be impacted.

Consider duplicating frequently updated metadata to keep a master copy.

Use context variables in the definition of metadata to update metadata through updating the context setting.

Some types of metadata
- delimited/XML/JSON file metadata
- database metadata
- generic schemas



### Processing data

tMap - use for joining data, mapping data
tAggregateRow - use for aggregate functions with group by
tSortRow - sorting rows
tSelectRow - selecting n-many rows from a table

### Context variables

Context variables let us configure environment variables so we can set up different execution environments like test, development and production environments.

tContextLoad - override context variables for a Job
tContextDump - export context variables

### Building executables and Docker images from Talend Studio Jobs

Exported jobs can only run on other Talend instances.
Built jobs are standalone jobs that can run anywhere.

You can build jobs that run on Windows, Linux and in Docker containers.
Build a job as an executable that can run on Windows or Linux or as a Docker image.

Docker 
- The Daemon is the the docker component that manages containers
- The Docker CLI runs on your local machine and lets you interface with the Daemon
- Docker images contain your Job and everything it needs to run (They're like a template or schema for creating containers)
- A container is a running instance of your Docker image

A standalone job contains:
- JAR files (which are Java based zip files)
- Files needed for deployment
- Contexts and variables
- BAT files (batch execution files for starting Jobs on Windows)
- SH files (Linux shell scripts for launching Jobs)

Building a Docker images requires:
- Connection to Docker host
- Image name and tag

Image name is the Job name and location in your Repository
Tag is the Job version (lets you distinguish between different versions of a Docker image created from the Job)


Docker CLI 
```cmd
<!-- view docker host info -->
docker -H dockerhost info

<!-- view docker images -->
docker -H dockerhost images

<!-- view running containers -->
docker -H dockerhost ps

<!-- running docker images -->
docker -H dockerhost run <image_name> [--context=selectcontext]
```

Control execution

![Working with iterations](images/iteration_flow_component.png)

tFileList - iterates over files in a directory
Use iterate connection with tFileList to loop a process on files stored in a directory

![Component variables](images/component_variables.png)


Error handling

Die-on error - stops the Job when an error is encountered in the component
Triggers - tranfer control based on subjob and component status
Kill a job - use the tKill component to kill a job when a specified condition is met
Warning - use the tWarn in the same way as you would use a tKill, but you get a warning message instead of killing the job.
log4jlevel - configure which messages to log to the console

![kill a job](images/kill_a_job.png)

Web services

tESBConsumer - for accessing web services
tXMLMap - mapping the XML response and configuring it to be used in data integration flow
